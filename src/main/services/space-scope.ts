 * services -- Space Scope

 * directory as their cwd but are free to pass absolute paths anywhere, so
 * "did this land somewhere the user can see" has to be asked explicitly.
 *
 * Lives in services/ rather than next to its main consumer in apps/runtime/
 * because the agent stream processor asks the same question and may not
