 * Chromium/Electron switches for running as root inside a container. Must be

 *
 * Deliberately does NOT set the Ozone platform. Halo cannot run displayless:
 * under --ozone-platform=headless, constructing any BrowserWindow dereferences a
 * null pointer and the process dies with SIGSEGV (exit 139) — show:true,
 * show:false and paintWhenInitiallyHidden:false all crash identically, because
 * it is window *construction* that fails, not rendering. Measured the same on
 * Electron 29 (Chromium 122) and 43 (Chromium 150). The AI browser needs a host
 * window to attach its <webview> guests to, so a deployment has to supply an
 * in-memory X server (Xvfb) and select x11 on the real command line — the image
 * entrypoint's job, since by the time this runs Ozone has already chosen.
 *
 * Setting it here would not work anyway: Ozone picks its platform before the
 * main script runs, so a late appendSwitch only changes what
 * getSwitchValue() reports, not what is loaded. It used to say 'headless' and
 * survived purely on that accident. Not worth keeping a line that reads as an
 * intent the process cannot satisfy.
 *
 * The same caveat applies to no-sandbox below, and it is not academic: the
 * container runs as root, and Electron's root check also reads the real command
 * line before this file is loaded, aborting with a FATAL at
 * electron_main_delegate.cc (exit 133). So --no-sandbox has to be on argv too —
 * the switch here only reaches process launches that happen later. Both flags
 * are the entrypoint's responsibility; see deploy/server/docker-entrypoint.sh.
